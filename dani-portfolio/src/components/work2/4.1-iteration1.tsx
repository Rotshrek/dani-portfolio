                    Throughout the project, we conducted 9 interviews with various stakeholders to gather information
                    and obtain feedback. Three interviews were with Clarify, our client, five were with industry users
                    and specialists, and one was with a marine engineering professor.

                        After the first interview with our client Clarify, we gained several insights that guided the
                        creation of our first sketches. One of the key findings was that the solution&apos;s primary
                        purpose isn&apos;t to read real-time datasets; instead, it&apos;s focused on supporting
                        decision-making and predictions in fish farms.

                        Clarify, his expertise in the field has enabled us to gain further knowledge of the users&apos;
                        needs.

                        Following the interview with Runar, we refined the initial drafts and developed the first
                        environmental data-widgets. Given that Runar worked at a sea-based facility, all fish pens were
                        connected to the same sensors, eliminating the need to switch between fish pens when reviewing
                        environmental data. Considering the importance of historical information in understanding how
                        the facility is doing, we experimented with various graph and table styles to effectively
                        represent these data sets.

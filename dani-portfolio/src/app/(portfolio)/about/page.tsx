                        My design journey began in Chile, my home country, where I completed my bachelor&#39;s degree in
                        design at one of the best universities in my country. I graduated with honors and ranked at the
                        top of my generation. Since then, I have completed various postgraduate courses in UX design and
                        have worked in different IT companies, first as a UX/UI designer and later as a UX/UI Lead
                        designer.

                        In August 2022, I relocated to Norway, embarking on the next chapter of my life: pursuing a
                        master&#39;s program in Interaction Design at NTNU. Presently, I am in the final year of my
                        master&#39;s program, holding the position of Teacher Assistant at NTNU, and actively
                        participating in level 2 of the Norwegian course provided by the university.

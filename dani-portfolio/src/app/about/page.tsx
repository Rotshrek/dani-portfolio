                    Hey there! I'm Dani, a designer with a passion for creating delightful digital experiences. I
                    consider myself a cheerful, responsible person who enjoys working in a team.
                </p>

                    My design journey began in Chile, my home country, where I completed my bachelor's degree in design
                    at one of the best universities in my country. I graduated with honors and ranked at the top of my
                    generation. Since then, I have completed various postgraduate courses in UX design and have worked
                    in different IT companies, first as a UX/UI designer and later as a UX/UI Lead designer.
                </p>

                    In August 2022, I relocated to Norway, embarking on the next chapter of my life: pursuing a master's
                    program in Interaction Design at NTNU. Presently, I am in the final year of my master's program,
                    holding the position of Teacher Assistant at NTNU, and actively participating in level 2 of the
                    Norwegian course provided by the university.

                    When I'm not knee-deep in design, you can catch me adventuring through fiction realms, baking
                    sweets, and giving my plants and my fish sidekick, Antonio, the VIP treatment they deserve.
